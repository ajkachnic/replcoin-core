# replcoin

*Warning*: This is in like super alpha so it's like really insecure. Use at your own risk.

replcoin is a Proof-of-stake crypto-currency based off of [NaiveCoin Proof-of-Stake](https://github.com/sandoche/NaivecoinStake-Proof-of-Stake-Core/). For the moment, it's basically just a Deno port of it, but it will improve soon. There's like no documentation because it's not intended to be used publicly for now.

## Todo

This is mainly just for my own personal tracking, since issues seem a bit overkill (might move to a GitHub project though)

- [ ] Add blockchain persistence (really important)
- [ ] Build out UI (will be in a separate repo)
- [ ] Add a better CLI
- [ ] Write usage documentation
- [ ] Write technical breakdown
- [ ] Actually lanuch it
